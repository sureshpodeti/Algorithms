Following are the techniques for proofs:
  1. proof by cases
  2. proof by contradiction
  3. uniqueness proofs
  4. proof by induction



proof by cases:
--------------
 In this proof technique we consider all the possible cases of a statement

 eg: x ∈ Z, x(x+1) is even
  proof:
      identifying the cases: since, x ∈ Z then x could be even or x is odd
              if x is even , x = 2n  where n ∈ Z
              x(x+1) = 2n(2n+1) , let y = n(2n+1) , y ∈ Z
                     = 2n.y  is even
               
              if x is odd, x = 2n+1 where  n ∈ Z
                         x(x+1) = (2n+1)(2n+2), product of odd and even is 
                        always even hence x(x+1) is even



proof by contradiction:
-----------------------
  find complete details on contradiction in another file.
 
  eg: prove that if x is rational, y is irrational, then x+y is irrational
  
  proof:
    To prove: x ∈  Q, y ∈  P => x+y ∈  P
    Assumption: assume x+y ∈  Q
    define some objects: y = (x+y) - x
                         since, (x+y) is rational from assumption, x is rational. 
                          substraction of one rational number from another leaves rational
                         so, y must be rational
    contradiction: but y given as irrational , hence we arrived at contradiction from our assumption
    conclusion: ∴ x+y ∈  P . (x+y) is irrational
