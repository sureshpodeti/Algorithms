  maximum product cutting:
    We have a rod of length 'n'. we need make atleast one cut.
    cut the rope in different parts of integer lengths in a way
    that maximizes product of lengths of all parts.

    brute-force approach:
     Let f(n) gives the maximum product obtained by cutting the 'n' length rod
    
     we can make cut at (n-1) different locations. 
       try making cut at each location and we have following cases:
        1. we can make cut at x âˆˆ {1,...,n-1} , and we could get:
           a.  x*(n-x) product or 
           b. x*f(n-x) product
        then, we should figure out the a, b. like that we need to find the same at
        x in all possible locations . and finally we should return the maximum product
