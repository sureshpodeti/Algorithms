   Tabulation: Bottom-up approach
     Starts its transition from the bottom-most base case dp[0] and reaches
     it destination state dp[n]. Here, dp table is being populated sequentially
     and we are directly accessing the calculated states from the table itself
     and hence, we call it tabulation method.
