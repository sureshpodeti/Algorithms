   1. state transition relation is difficult to think               state transition relation is easy to think

   2. code gets complicated when lot of conditions are              code is easy and less complicated 
      required

   3. Fast,as we directly access previous states from               slow due to lot of recursive calls and return 
      the table                                                     statements

   4. If all subproblems must be solved at least once,              If some subproblems in the subproblem space need
      a bottom-up dynamic programming algorithm usually             not be solved at all, the memoized solution has the
      outperforms a top-down memoized algorithm by a                advantage of solving only those subproblems that are 
      constant factor                                               definitely required
   
   5. In tabulated version, starting from the first entry           Unlike the tabulated version, all entries of the lookup
      all entries are filled one by one                             table are not necessarily filled in memoized version. The 
                                                                    table is filled on demand
